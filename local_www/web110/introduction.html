<p>Personal background:i was born in Greensboro, north Carolina but moved back in forth from north Carolina to cocoa beach, Flordia till i was twelve then eventually made my what was thought to be my final migration to cocoa beach, Flordia. i went to cocoa beach high school i played football for the minute men for a brief while then i quit school in 10th grade and pursed a career doing site development till i was 21 then i was incarcerated for three and half years (2015-late 2018) and it was not fun at all. because of that i do enjoy things alot more and can feel the turning of the days. when i was released from prison  i moved to Charlotte were my family resides which mean the world to me i started working on my G.E.D and obtained that and now i am in collage.</p>

<p>professional background:I am currently a trades men doing H.V.A.C which i enjoy it is a labor trade but it requires knowledge as well. i say it all the time "its just like working on cars but in 130 degree attics". i also own a fairly successful lawn maintenance business which is something else i enjoy its a bit of a brain child of sorts it is what you make it.</p>
