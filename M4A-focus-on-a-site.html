	<h2>Focus on a Site - Youtube</h2>
	<p>Hello, today i will be speaking abought my favorite website which is youtube. It is well known and recognized around the country.</p>
	<p>Youtube began in 2005 after the creators relized there was a need for a website that could host videos uploaded by users. It received 11.5 million dollars as an investment from sequoia captial the same year.</p>
	<p>Youtube has grown into quite the website since 2005 and rather quickly in my opinion. With stats like 300 hours worth the videos uploaded every minute,5 billion videos uploaded every day and 1.3 billion online users every day. cable companys cant compete, its been predicted that half of all under 30's population dosen't pay for t.v. subscriptions because of youtube.</p>
	<p>My main reason for enjoying youtube is the mobility of it. It keeps me from staying on social media to much, places like Facebook where a persons real mind is no longer spoken but instead coverd up by memes.</p>
	<h3>focus on web design questions 1-6.</h3>
	<ol>
	<strong><li>What is the purpose of the site?</li></strong>
	<dl>To host videos uploaded by users.</dl>
	<strong><li>Who is the inteded audience?</li></strong>
	<dl>In March youtube drew 31.8 billion users aged 18 to 24,so i would guess that would be considered young adult.</dl>
	<strong><li>Do you believe the site reachs its audience?</li></strong>
	<dl>Without a question, youtube displays billions of videos for everyone.</dl>
	<strong><li>Was this site useful to you? why or why not?</li></strong>
	<dl>Absolutely, i use it in day to day activities any thing from music to using a channel called math antics to help me with my homework i even watch tutorials that provide information that helps me work on my truck.</dl>
	<strong><li>List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of this website: background, backgrounds of page sections,text,logo, navigation buttons, and so on.</li></strong>
	<dl>The colors on the front page consist of red and white, more white then red but the majority of white draws emphasis on the red. The backgrounds white. The page selction is white with a black font. The text logo is red,white,and black. The navigation buttons are a black font. Its a fairly simple home page.</dl>
	<strong><li>How does the use of color and graphics enhance the website.</li></strong>
	<dl>Its odd i never really thought abought how simple youtube is. The red really pops in the logo but the background is just white.</dl>
	</ol>
