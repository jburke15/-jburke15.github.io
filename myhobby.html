	<p>My favorite personal favorite hobby beside school and owning a business is riding a road bike. The innocence a bike provides for me is difficult to
 put in words but it provides me with a essence of my childhood. I started racing bikes competitively at twelve years old when i had a quick discussion with 
 a couple of buddys abought how to sign up and it was like i couldnt sign out. I raced twenty inch bicycles from age 12 to 17 starting as rookie where obtained 
15th in the sountheast of the united states. Later i pushed through the ranks and rode novice for awhile due to accumulating so many points from going
to different races nation wide. After ranking up i was invited to the national cup in ohio were i had a bad crash while practicing but still managed
to obtain 7th out of 15 riders.</p>
